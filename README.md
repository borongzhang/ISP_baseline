# Baseline Models for Solving Inverse Scattering Problem

## Overview
This repository currently contains four baseline deterministic models for ISP (Image Signal Processing) tasks. The models included are:

- **SwitchNet**
- **Uncompressed Equivariant Model**
- **Compressed Equivariant Model**
- **Wideband Butterfly Network**

## Demos
Demos for these models can be found in the `colabs` folder.
